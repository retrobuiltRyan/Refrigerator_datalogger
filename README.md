What happens to your refrigerator temperature when you open the door? When you leave the door open? I built a data-logging device and stuck it in my fridge for a few hours to find out. I have no idea why I spent a weekend doing this.
Arduino logs temp and humidity data to a microSD card. Use exel to graph and plot data. A photosensor confirms the fridge light if you open the door. Sample graph of data is shown. The old fridge form this experience has a wide temp swing. Not a great fridge, ( came with the rental).
